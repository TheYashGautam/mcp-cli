# MCP-CLI

**A package manager that simplifies installing and configuring Model Context Protocols (MCPs).**  

Think `npm install` or `apt-get` — but for MCPs.  
Configure providers with one command, no manual Docker or JSON editing.  

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install a provider
mcp install github

# Add a secret
mcp secrets set GITHUB_TOKEN=xxx

# Start all providers
mcp up

# Stop everything
mcp down

# Check status
mcp status
```

---

## Features (MVP)

* `mcp install <provider>` → auto config & setup
* `mcp secrets set` → secure secret storage
* `mcp up` / `mcp down` → manage containers
* `mcp status` → check running MCPs
* JSON/YAML config auto-generated — no hand editing

---

## Vision

Developers today spend hours configuring MCPs with Docker images, secrets, and JSON files.
The goal of **MCP-CLI** is to make this as easy as:

```bash
pip install
```

One-line installs, secure secrets, zero config pain.
Our vision: **the package manager for AI context providers**.

## Roadmap

* [ ] Health checks for MCP providers
* [ ] Profiles (e.g. `mcp up dev-analytics`)
* [ ] SSO + secrets manager integration
* [ ] Public MCP registry (`mcp search notion`)
* [ ] Cross-platform installer binaries (Go/Rust)

## About this Project

This project was started as a way to reduce the friction of working with MCPs.
The mission is to make MCP adoption accessible to every developer — from hackathon prototypes to enterprise-scale AI systems.
